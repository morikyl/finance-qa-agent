## Agent Types

### 1. **Triage Agent**

- **Categories**: 
  - **Tactical ‚Äì Basic**: Directly answerable from provided data
  - **Tactical ‚Äì Assumption-Based**: Requires logical assumptions or estimates
  - **Conceptual**: Definitional or methodological questions
- **Tools**: File Search Tool, Web Search Tool
- **Output**: JSON classification with routing instructions
- **Delegation**: Routes questions to appropriate specialized agents

### 2. **Assumption Agent** 
- **Purpose**: Handles complex financial questions requiring assumptions, estimates, and multi-step calculations
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Phase 1**: Generate complete plan with formula validation
  2. **Phase 2**: Execute step-by-step resolution with mandatory tool usage
  3. **Phase 3**: Final calculation and validation
- **Tools**: File Search Tool, Web Search Tool
- **Output**: Structured JSON with complete calculation tree and provenance

### 3. **Basic Agent** 
- **Purpose**: Handles straightforward financial questions answerable directly from context
- **Capabilities**: Direct data extraction, simple calculations, ratio computations
- **Tools**: File Search Tool, Web Search Tool
- **Output**: JSON with direct answers and calculations
- **Access**: Uses both tools to validate data and verify calculations

### 4. **Conceptual Agent** 
- **Purpose**: Answers questions about financial concepts, definitions, and methodologies
- **Capabilities**: Concept explanations, methodology descriptions, relationship analysis
- **Tools**: File Search Tool, Web Search Tool
- **Output**: JSON with conceptual explanations and examples
- **Access**: Uses tools to research authoritative definitions and validate concepts

### 5. **Critic Agent** 
- **Purpose**: Provides critical review and validation of other agents' analyses
- **Responsibilities**: Data accuracy verification, calculation validation, logical soundness assessment
- **Tools**: File Search Tool, Web Search Tool
- **Output**: Detailed critique and validation report
- **Access**: Uses both tools to independently verify data and validate assumptions

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from src.orchestration import main

# Run the system with default questions
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Custom Questions

```python
# Modify the questions list in src/orchestration.py
questions = [
    "What is the market debt to equity ratio of Costco?",
    "Calculate the EV/Sales ratio for 2024",
    "What is adjusted EBITDA for the year ending in 2024?"
]
```

### Agent Configuration

```python
# Configure agent models and tools
assumption_agent = Agent(
    name="assumption_agent",
    model="gpt-4o",  # or "gpt-4o-mini" for cost optimization
    tools=[file_search_tool, web_search_tool],
    instructions=assumption_agent_prompt,
    handoffs=[critic_agent]
)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key-here  # Optional: for enhanced web search
```

### Tool Configuration

#### File Search Tool
```python
file_search_tool = FileSearchTool(
    vector_store_ids=["your-vector-store-id"],
    max_num_results=5,
    include_search_results=True,
    ranking_options=None,
    filters=None
)
```

#### Web Search Tool
```python
web_search_tool = WebSearchTool(
    user_location=None,
    search_context_size="medium"  # "low", "medium", or "high"
)
```

### Agent Prompts
- Customize agent behavior by modifying the prompt templates in `src/orchestration.py`
- Each agent has specific instructions for optimal performance
- Prompts include tool usage requirements and output format specifications

## üìä Data Sources

### Financial Context (`src/data/context.txt`)
- Costco Wholesale Corporation financial statements (2022-2024)
- Consolidated Income Statements
- Consolidated Balance Sheets
- Consolidated Statements of Equity
- Financial Notes and Disclosures

### Vector Store Integration
- OpenAI vector store for semantic search
- Configurable search parameters
- Result ranking and filtering options

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Question Input
- User submits financial question
- System initializes with triage agent

### 2. Classification & Routing
- Triage agent analyzes question using both search tools
- Classifies into appropriate category
- **Delegates to specialized agent** based on classification

### 3. Analysis & Calculation
- **Specialized agent** (Basic/Assumption/Conceptual) processes question
- **Each specialized agent has full access to both tools**:
  - File Search Tool for company-specific data
  - Web Search Tool for formula validation and industry standards
- Performs calculations with comprehensive validation

### 4. Review & Validation
- Critic agent reviews analysis using both tools
- Validates calculations and logic independently
- Provides quality assurance with tool-enabled verification

### 5. Output Generation
- Structured JSON response from specialized agent
- Complete calculation provenance
- Confidence levels and assumptions
- Optional critic review if handoff is configured

## üìù Output Formats

### Triage Agent Output
```json
{
    "classification": "tactical_assumption_based",
    "reason": "Question requires assumptions and estimates",
    "search_results": "Context validation results"
}
```

### Assumption Agent Output
```json
{
    "question": "What is the market debt to equity ratio?",
    "formula_validation": {
        "formula": "Market D/E = Total Debt / Market Value of Equity",
        "internet_validation_result": "Formula confirmed via web search"
    },
    "plan": ["Step 1: Find total debt", "Step 2: Find market equity"],
    "execution": {
        "step_1": {
            "description": "Find total debt components",
            "file_search_results": {...},
            "calculation": "103 + 5,794 + 4,052 = 8,949 million",
            "result": 8949
        }
    },
    "final_result": 0.0214,
    "confidence_level": "High - All components sourced",
    "assumptions_made": [...]
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run the main system
python src/orchestration.py

# Test specific agents
python -c "
import asyncio
from src.orchestration import assumption_agent, Runner
result = asyncio.run(Runner.run(assumption_agent, 'What is the market debt to equity ratio?'))
print(result.final_output)
"
```

### Validation
- Each agent includes built-in validation mechanisms
- Critic agent provides independent review
- Tool usage is mandatory and tracked
- All calculations include provenance

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

2. **API Key Issues**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY  # Verify it's set
   ```

3. **Vector Store Errors**
   - Verify vector store ID is correct
   - Ensure context file is uploaded
   - Check OpenAI account permissions

4. **Tool Usage Errors**
   - Verify tool configurations
   - Check internet connectivity for web search
   - Ensure proper tool permissions

### Debug Mode
```python
# Enable tracing for debugging
with trace("financial_analysis_workflow") as tracer:
    result = await Runner.run(agent, question)
    print(f"Trace events: {tracer.events}")
```
