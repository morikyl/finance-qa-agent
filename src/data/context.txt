The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.
